abstract = {Plastic pollution is the challenging problem of the world due to usage of plastic in daily life. Plastic is essential for packaging food and other goods and utensils to avoid the risk of microbial attack. Due to its hydrophobic nature, it is used for wrapping as laminates or packaging liquid substances in pouches and sachets. The tensile strength of the plastic is more therefore it is used for manufacturing carrying bags that can bear heavy loads. Plastic is available in various forms as per the requirements in our daily life. Annually millions to trillions of polyethene carry bags are being manufactured and utilized throughout the world. The plastic requires millions of years for natural degradation. The physical and chemical processes are able to degrade plastic material at the meager level by 200 to 500 years in natural conditions. Many industries focus on recycling of plastic. Biodegradation is a comparatively slow and cheaper process that involves microbes. To dispose of plastic completely there is a need of an integrated process in which all the possible methods of disposal are involved and used sustainably so that minimum depletion occurs to the livestock and the environment. In the current review, we could try to emphasize the intricate nature of plastic polymers, pollution caused by it and possible mitigation strategies for plastic waste management.},

abstract = {Aims: To better understand the role of PueA and PueB from Pseudomonas chlororaphis in polyurethane degradation, the present study was conducted to create insertional mutants in their respective genes. Methods and Results: Growth kinetic studies showed that the pueA knockout mutant had a greater effect than the pueB knockout mutant. The pueA mutant had an 80% decrease in cell density from that of the wild type, while the pueB mutant had an 18% decrease in cell density. Polyurethane utilization followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The pueA and pueB mutants exhibited a 17% and 10% decrease respectively in growth rate using polyurethane when compared with the wild type. Conclusions: In this present study, pueA and pueB, are shown to be part of an ABC transporter gene cluster that consists of seven open reading frames. Mutational analysis results suggest that PueA may play a more major role in polyurethane degradation than PueB based on cell density and growth rates. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results from this study provide a starting point for the eventual enhancement and bioremediation of polyurethane waste. Understanding the role of polyurethane-degrading enzymes is useful for the creation of strains for this purpose. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {Marine plastic debris is a growing concern that has captured the general public's attention. While the negative impacts of plastic debris on oceanic macrobiota, including mammals and birds, are well documented, little is known about its influence on smaller marine residents, including microbes that have key roles in ocean biogeochemistry. Our work provides a new perspective on microbial communities inhabiting microplastics that includes its effect on microbial biogeochemical activities and a description of the cross-domain communities inhabiting plastic particles. This study is among the first molecular ecology, plastic debris biota surveys in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. It has identified fundamental differences in the functional potential and taxonomic composition of plastic-associated microbes versus planktonic microbes found in the surrounding open-ocean habitat. Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known, however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the “great Pacific garbage patch.” The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2 to 5 mm and >5 mm) ranged from 0.35 to 3.7 particles m −3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP = gross primary production − community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa , Cyanobacteria , Alphaproteobacteria , and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from the surrounding picoplankton and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes, and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions, and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways, and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from those of free-living planktonic microbial communities.  IMPORTANCE Marine plastic debris is a growing concern that has captured the general public's attention.

abstract = {The concept of a ‘plastisphere microbial community' arose from research on aquatic plastic debris, while the effect of plastics on microbial communities in soils remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined the inhabiting microbial communities of two plastic debris ecosystems with regard to their diversity and composition relative to plastic-free soils from the same area using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Furthermore, we studied the plastic-colonizing potential of bacteria originating from both study sites as a measure of surface adhesion to UV-weathered polyethylene (PE) using high-magnification field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The high plastic content of the soils was associated with a reduced alpha diversity and a significantly different structure of the microbial communities. The presence of plastic debris in soils did not specifically enrich bacteria known to degrade plastic, as suggested by earlier studies, but rather shifted the microbial community towards highly abundant autotrophic bacteria potentially tolerant to hydrophobic environments and known to be important for biocrust formation. The bacterial inoculates from both sites formed dense biofilms on the surface and in micrometer-scale surface cracks of the UV-weathered PE chips after 100 days of in vitro incubation with visible threadlike EPS structures and cross-connections enabling surface adhesion. High-resolution FESEM imaging further indicates that the microbial colonization catalyzed some of the surface degradation of PE. In essence, this study suggests the concept of a ‘terrestrial plastisphere' as a diverse consortium of microorganisms including autotrophs and other pioneering species paving the way for those members of the consortium that may eventually break down the plastic compounds.},

abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most important synthetic polymers used today. Unfortunately, the polymers accumulate in nature and to date no highly active enzymes are known that can degrade it at high velocity. Enzymes involved in PET degradation are mainly-and-hydrolases, like cutinases and related enzymes (EC 3.1.1). Currently, only a small number of such enzymes are well characterized. In this work, a search algorithm was developed that identified 504 possible PET hydrolase candidate genes from various databases. A further global search that comprised more than 16 Gb of sequence information within 108 marine and 25 terrestrial metagenomes obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genome (IMG) database detected 349 putative PET hydrolases. Heterologous expression of four such candidate enzymes verified the function of these enzymes and confirmed the usefulness of the developed search algorithm. In this way, two novel and thermo-stable enzymes with high potential for downstream application were partially characterized. Clustering of 504 novel enzyme candidates based on amino acid similarities indicated that PET hydrolases mainly occur in the phyla of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Within the Proteobacteria, the Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacte-ria, and Gammaproteobacteria were the main hosts. Remarkably enough, in the marine environment, bacteria affiliated with the phylum Bacteroidetes appear to be the main hosts of PET hydrolase genes, rather than Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria, as observed for the terrestrial metagenomes. Our data further imply that PET hydro-lases are truly rare enzymes. The highest occurrence of 1.5 hits/Mb was observed in sequences from a sample site containing crude oil. IMPORTANCE Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accumulates in our environment without significant microbial conversion. Although a few PET hydrolases are already known, it is still unknown how frequently they appear and with which main bacterial phyla they are affiliated. In this study, deep sequence mining of protein databases and meta-genomes demonstrated that PET hydrolases indeed occur at very low frequencies in the environment. Furthermore, it was possible to link them to phyla that were previously not known to harbor such enzymes. This work contributes novel knowledge on the phy-logenetic relationships, the recent evolution, and the global distribution of PET hydro-lases. Finally, we describe the biochemical traits of four novel PET hydrolases. Streit WR. 2018.

abstract = {Plastic production has increased dramatically, leading to accumulated plastic waste in the ocean. Marine plastics can be broken down into microplastics (<5 mm) by sunlight, machinery, and pressure. The accumulation of microplastics in organisms and the release of plastic additives can adversely affect the health of marine organisms. Biodegradation is one way to address plastic pollution in an environmentally friendly manner. Marine microorganisms can be more adapted to fluctuating environmental conditions such as salinity, temperature, pH, and pressure compared with terrestrial microorganisms, providing new opportunities to address plastic pollution. Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria), Bacteroidota (Bacteroidetes), Bacillota (Firmicutes), and Cyanobacteria were frequently found on plastic biofilms and may degrade plastics. Currently, diverse plastic-degrading bacteria are being isolated from marine environments such as offshore and deep oceanic waters, especially Pseudomonas spp. Bacillus spp. Alcanivoras spp. and Actinomycetes. Some marine fungi and algae have also been revealed as plastic degraders. In this review, we focused on the advances in plastic biodegradation by marine microorganisms and their enzymes (esterase, cutinase, laccase, etc.) involved in the process of biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene (PP) and highlighted the need to study plastic biodegradation in the deep sea.},

A transposon-insertion mutant, which had lost the ability to degrade DPNR, was isolated to identify the rubber degradation genes. Sequencing analysis indicated that the transposon was inserted into a putative oxygenase gene, latA. The deduced amino acid sequence of latA has 36% identity with that of roxA, which encodes a rubber oxygenase of Xanthomonas sp. strain 35Y. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LatA constitutes a distinct group from RoxA. Heterologous expression in a Methylibium host and deletion analysis of latA indicated that the latA product is responsible for the depolymerization of DPNR. The quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that the transcription of latA is induced during the growth on DPNR. These results strongly suggest that latA is directly involved in the degradation of rubber in NS21.},

abstract = {Polystyrene (PS), a major plastic waste, is difficult to biodegrade due to its unique chemical structure that comprises phenyl moieties attached to long linear alkanes. In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of PS by mesophilic bacterial cultures obtained from various soils in common environments. Two new strains, Pseudomonas lini JNU01 and Acinetobacter johnsonii JNU01, were specifically enriched in non-carbonaceous nutrient medium, with PS as the only source of carbon. Their growth after culturing in basal media increased more than 3-fold in the presence of PS. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis, used to confirm the formation of hydroxyl groups and potentially additional chemical bond groups, showed an increase in the amount of oxidized PS samples. Moreover, field emission scanning electron microcopy analysis confirmed PS biodegradation by biofilms of the screened microbes. Water contact angle measurement additionally offered insights into the increased hydrophilic characteristics of PS films. Bioinformatics and transcriptional analysis of A. johnsonii JNU01 revealed alkane-1-monooxygenase (AlkB) to be involved in PS biodegradation, which was confirmed by the hydroxylation of PS using recombinant AlkB. These results provide significant insights into the discovery of novel functions of Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp., as well as their potential as PS decomposers.},

In-depth investigations through preliminary bioinformatic analyses and enzymatic assays on the supernatant of R7 grown in the presence of PE confirmed the activation of genes encoding laccase-like enzymes. Moreover, the transcriptomic data allowed identifying candidate genes for the further steps of short aliphatic chain oxidation including alkB gene encoding an alkane monooxygenase, cyp450 gene encoding cytochrome P450 hydroxylase, and genes encoding membrane transporters. The PE biodegradative system was also validated by FTIR analysis on R7 cells grown on polyethylene.},

abstract = {Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in land-fills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.},

abstract = {Environment plastic litter accumulation is a significant concern, needing urgent advancements in plastic waste management. Recent investigations into plastic biodegradation by bacteria and their enzymes are creating exciting unique opportunities for the development of biotechnological plastic waste treatment methods. This review summarizes information on bacterial and enzymatic biodegradation of plastic in a wide range of synthetic plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyurethane (PUR), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Plastic biodegradation is facilitated by Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Streptomyces, and Rhodococcus bacteria, and enzymes such as proteases, esterases, lipases, and glycosidases. Molecular and analytical procedures used to analyze biodegradation processes are outlined, as are the obstacles in verifying plastic breakdown using these methods. Taken together, the findings of this study will contribute significantly to the construction of a library of high-efficiency bacterial isolates and consortiums and their enzymes for use in plastic biosynthesis. This information is useful to researchers investigating plastic bioremediation and a supplement to the scientific and grey literature already accessible. Finally, the review focuses on expanding the understanding of bacterial capacity to break-down plastic utilizing modern biotechnological methods, bio-nanotechnological-based materials, and their future role in resolving pollution problems.},

abstract = {Traditional plastics, predominantly derived from petrochemicals, are extensively utilized in modern industry and daily life. However, inadequate management and disposal practices have resulted in widespread environmental contamination, with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene being the most prevalent pollutants. Biological methods for plastic degradation have garnered significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and potential for resource recovery, positioning them as promising strategies for sustainable plastic waste management. While polyethylene terephthalate, characterized by its relatively less stable C-O bonds, has been extensively studied and demonstrates significant potential for biodegradation. In contrast, the biodegradation of other plastics remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stability of their C-C backbone structures. This review comprehensively examines the state-of-the-art biotechnology for treating these traditional plastics, focusing on: (1) the roles of specific microorganisms and enzymes, their taxonomic classifications, and the metabolic pathways involved in plastic biodegradation; and (2) a proposed two-stage hybrid approach integrating physicochemical and biological processes to enhance the biodegradation or upcycling of these traditional plastics. Additionally, the review highlights the critical role of multi-omics approaches and tailored strategies in enhancing the efficiency of plastic biodegradation while examining the impact of plastic molecular structures and additives on their degradation potential. It also addresses key challenges and delineates future research directions to foster the development of innovative biological methods for the effective and sustainable management of plastic waste.},

abstract = {Polyester polyurethane (PU) coatings are widely used to help protect underlying structural surfaces but are susceptible to biological degradation. PUs are susceptible to degradation by Pseudomonas species, due in part to the degradative activity of secreted hydrolytic enzymes. Microorganisms often respond to environmental cues by secreting enzymes or secondary metabolites to benefit their survival. This study investigated the impact of exposing several Pseudomonas strains to select carbon sources on the degradation of the colloidal polyester polyurethane Impranil DLN (Impranil). The prototypic Pseudomonas protegens strain Pf-5 exhibited Impranil-degrading activities when grown in sodium citrate but not in glucose-containing medium. Glucose also inhibited the induction of Impranil-degrading activity by citrate-fed Pf-5 in a dose-dependent manner. Biochemical and mutational analyses identified two extracellular lipases present in the Pf-5 culture supernatant (PueA and PueB) that were involved in degradation of Impranil. Deletion of the pueA gene reduced Impranil-clearing activities, while pueB deletion exhibited little effect. Removal of both genes was necessary to stop degradation of the polyurethane. Bioinformatic analysis showed that putative Cbr/Hfq/Crc-mediated regulatory elements were present in the intergenic sequences upstream of both pueA and pueB genes. Our results confirmed that both PueA and PueB extracellular enzymes act in concert to degrade Impranil. Furthermore, our data showed that carbon sources in the growth medium directly affected the levels of Impranil-degrading activity but that carbon source effects varied among Pseudomonas strains. This study uncovered an intricate and complicated regulation of P. protegens PU degradation activity controlled by carbon catabolite repression.},

abstract = {Polyurethanes (PU) are widely used synthetic polymers. The growing amount of PU used industrially has resulted in a worldwide increase of plastic wastes. The related environmental pollution as well as the limited availability of the raw materials based on petrochemicals requires novel solutions for their efficient degradation and recycling. The degradation of the polyester PU Impranil DLN by the polyester hydrolases LC cutinase (LCC), TfCut2, Tcur1278 and Tcur0390 was analyzed using a turbidimetric assay. The highest hydrolysis rates were obtained with TfCut2 and Tcur0390. TfCut2 also showed a significantly higher substrate affinity for Impranil DLN than the other three enzymes, indicated by a higher adsorption constant K. Significant weight losses of the solid thermoplastic polyester PU (TPU) Elastollan B85A-10 and C85A-10 were detected as a result of the enzymatic degradation by all four polyester hydrolases. Within a reaction time of 200 h at 70 °C, LCC caused weight losses of up to 4.9% and 4.1% of Elastollan B85A-10 and C85A-10, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography confirmed a preferential degradation of the larger polymer chains. Scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks at the surface of the TPU cubes as a result of enzymatic surface erosion. Analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that the observed weight losses were a result of the cleavage of ester bonds of the polyester TPU.},

abstract = {Biodegradation is a plausible route toward sustainable management of the millions of tons of plastic waste that have accumulated in terrestrial and marine environments. However, the global diversity of plastic-degrading enzymes remains poorly understood. Taking advantage of global environmental DNA sampling projects, here we constructed hidden Markov models from experimentally verified enzymes and mined ocean and soil metagenomes to assess the global potential of microorganisms to degrade plastics. By controlling for false positives using gut microbiome data, we compiled a catalogue of over 30,000 nonredundant enzyme homologues with the potential to degrade 10 different plastic types. While differences between the ocean and soil microbiomes likely reflect the base compositions of these environments, we find that ocean enzyme abundance increases with depth as a response to plastic pollution and not merely taxonomic composition. By obtaining further pollution measurements, we observed that the abundance of the uncovered enzymes in both ocean and soil habitats significantly correlates with marine and country-specific plastic pollution trends. Our study thus uncovers the earth microbiome's potential to degrade plastics, providing evidence of a measurable effect of plastic pollution on the global microbial ecology as well as a useful resource for further applied research. IMPORTANCE Utilization of synthetic biology approaches to enhance current plastic degradation processes is of crucial importance, as natural plastic degradation processes are very slow. For instance, the predicted lifetime of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle under ambient conditions ranges from 16 to 48 years. Moreover, although there is still unexplored diversity in microbial communities, synergistic degradation of plastics by microorganisms holds great potential to revolutionize the management of global plastic waste. To this end, the methods and data on novel plastic-degrading enzymes presented here can help researchers by (i) providing further information about the taxonomic diversity of such enzymes as well as understanding of the mechanisms and steps involved in the biological breakdown of plastics, (ii) pointing toward the areas with increased availability of novel enzymes, and (iii) giving a basis for further application in industrial plastic waste biodegradation. Importantly, our findings provide evidence of a measurable effect of plastic pollution on the global microbial ecology.},

abstract = {Petroleum-based plastics are durable and accumulate in all ecological niches. Knowledge on enzymatic degradation is sparse. Today, less than 50 verified plastics-active enzymes are known. First examples of enzymes acting on the polymers polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PUR) have been reported together with a detailed biochemical and structural description. Furthermore, very few polyamide (PA) oligomer active enzymes are known. In this article, the current known enzymes acting on the synthetic polymers PET and PUR are briefly summarized, their published activity data were collected and integrated into a comprehensive open access database. The Plastics-Active Enzymes Database (PAZy) represents an inventory of known and experimentally verified enzymes that act on synthetic fossil fuel-based polymers. Almost 3000 homologs of PET-active enzymes were identified by profile hidden Markov models. Over 2000 homologs of PUR-active enzymes were identified by BLAST. Based on multiple sequence alignments, conservation analysis identified the most conserved amino acids, and sequence motifs for PET- and PUR-active enzymes were derived.},
